abstract = {We give the first approximation algorithm for the generalized network Steiner problem, a problem in network design. An instance consists of a network with link-costs and, for each pair {\{}i, j{\}} of nodes, an edge- connectivity requirement rij. The goal is to find a minimum-cost network using the available links and satisfying the requirements. Our algorithm outputs a solution whose cost is within 2[log2(r + 1)] of optimal, where r is the highest requirement value. In the course of proving the performance guarantee, we prove a combinatorial min- max approximate equality relating minimum-cost networks to maximum packings of certain kinds of cuts. As a consequence of the proof of this theorem, we obtain an approximation algorithm for optimally packing these cuts; we show that this algorithm has application to estimating the reliability of a probabilistic network.},

abstract = {Availability of large-scale experimental data for cell biology is enabling computational methods to systematically model the behaviour of cellular networks. This review surveys the recent advances in the field of graph-driven methods for analysing complex cellular networks. The methods are outlined on three levels of increasing complexity, ranging from methods that can characterize global or local structural properties of networks to methods that can detect groups of interconnected nodes, called motifs or clusters, potentially involved in common elementary biological functions. We also briefly summarize recent approaches to data integration and network inference through graph-based formalisms. Finally, we highlight some challenges in the field and offer our personal view of the key future trends and developments in graph-based analysis of large-scale datasets.},

abstract = {We study the prize-collecting Steiner tree (PCST), prize-collecting traveling salesman (PCTSP), and prize-collecting path (PC-Path) problems. Given a graph {\$}(V,E){\$} with a cost on each edge and a penalty (a.k.a. prize) on each node, the goal is to find a tree (for PCST), cycle (for PCTSP), or path (for PC-Path) that minimizes the sum of the edge costs in the tree/cycle/path and the penalties of the nodes not spanned by it. In addition to being a useful theoretical tool for helping to solve other optimization problems, PCST has been applied fruitfully by AT{\&}T to the optimization of real-world telecommunications networks. The most recent improvements for the first two problems, a 2-approximation algorithm for each, appeared first in 1992; a 2-approximation for PC-Path appeared in 2003. The natural linear programming relaxation of PCST has an integrality gap of 2, which has been a barrier to further improvements for this problem. We present {\$}(2-\backslashepsilon){\$}-approximation algorithms for all three problems, connected by a unified technique for improving prize-collecting algorithms that allows us to circumvent the integrality gap barrier. Specifically, our approximation ratio for prize-collecting Steiner tree is below 1.9672.},

First, we review several basic combinatorial problems that have been stated in terms of directed hypergraphs and have been studied in the literature in the framework of different application domains. Among them, transitive closure, tran- sitive reduction, flow and cut problems, and minimum weight traversal problems. For such problems we illustrate some of the most important algorithmic results in the context of both static and dynamic applica- tions. Second, we address a specific dynamic problem which finds sev- eral interesting applications, especially in the framework of knowledge representation: the maintenance of minimum weight hyperpaths under hyperarc weight increases and hyperarc deletions. For such problem we provide a new efficient algorithm applicable for a wide class of hyperpath weight measures. Keywords:},

abstract = {We give the first polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for the Steiner forest problem on planar graphs and, more generally, on graphs of bounded genus. As a first step, we show how to build a Steiner forest spanner for such graphs. The crux of the process is a clustering procedure called prize-collecting clustering that breaks down the input instance into separate subinstances which are easier to handle; moreover, the terminals in different subinstances are far from each other. Each subinstance has a relatively inexpensive Steiner tree connecting all its terminals, and the subinstances can be solved (almost) separately. Another building block is a PTAS for Steiner forest on graphs of bounded treewidth. Surprisingly, Steiner forest is NP-hard even on graphs of treewidth 3. Therefore, our PTAS for bounded treewidth graph needs a nontrivial combination of approximation arguments and dynamic programming on the tree decomposition. We further show that Steiner forest can be solved in polynomial time for series-parallel graphs (graphs of treewidth at most two) by a novel combination of dynamic programming and minimum cut computations, completing our thorough complexity study of Steiner forest in the range of bounded treewidth graphs, planar graphs, and bounded genus graphs.},

First, we present a simpler analysis of the polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) of Borradaile et al. 12 for the Euclidean Steiner forest problem. This is done by proving a new structural property and modifying the dynamic programming by adding a new piece of information to each dynamic programming state. Next we develop a PTAS for a well-motivated case, i.e., the multiplicative case, of prize-collecting and budgeted Steiner forest. The ideas used in the algorithm may have applications in design of a broad class of bicriteria PTASs. At the end, we demonstrate why PTASs for these problems can be hard in the general Euclidean case (and thus for PTASs we cannot go beyond the multiplicative case).},

More precisely, we show any alpha-approximation algorithm for these problems on graphs of bounded treewidth gives an (alpha + epsilon)-approximation algorithm for these problems on planar graphs (and more generally bounded-genus graphs), for any constant epsilon > 0. Since PCS, PCTSP, and PCST can be solved exactly on graphs of bounded treewidth using dynamic programming, we obtain PTASs for these problems on planar graphs and bounded-genus graphs. In contrast, we show PCSF is APX-hard to approximate on series-parallel graphs, which are planar graphs of treewidth at most 2. This result is interesting on its own because it gives the first provable hardness separation between prize-collecting and non-prize-collecting (regular) versions of the problems: regular Steiner Forest is known to be polynomially solvable on series-parallel graphs and admits a PTAS on graphs of bounded treewidth. An analogous hardness result can be shown for Euclidian PCSF. This ends the common belief that prize-collecting variants should not add any new hardness to the problems.},

abstract = {High-throughput quantitative genetic interaction (GI) measurements provide detailed information regarding the structure of the underlying biological pathways by reporting on functional dependencies between genes. However, the analytical tools for fully exploiting such information lag behind the ability to collect these data. We present a novel Bayesian learning method that uses quantitative phenotypes of double knockout organisms to automatically reconstruct detailed pathway structures. We applied our method to a recent data set that measures GIs for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) genes, using the unfolded protein response as a quantitative phenotype. The results provided reconstructions of known functional pathways including N-linked glycosylation and ER-associated protein degradation. It also contained novel relationships, such as the placement of SGT2 in the tail-anchored biogenesis pathway, a finding that we experimentally validated. Our approach should be readily applicable to the next generation of quantitative GI data sets, as assays become available for additional phenotypes and eventually higher-level organisms.},

Once a reconstruction of the network of interactions is achieved, analysis of its structural features and its dynamic behaviour can take place. Mathematical modelling techniques are used to simulate the complex behaviour of cell signalling networks, which ultimately sheds light on the mechanisms leading to complex diseases or helps in the identification of drug targets. A variety of databases containing information on cell signalling pathways have been developed in conjunction with methodologies to access and analyse the data. In principle, the scenario is prepared to make the most of this information for the analysis of the dynamics of signalling pathways. However, are the knowledge repositories of signalling pathways ready to realize the systems biology promise?

Here we address the capacitated case, and show how the simplex operations can be specialized in order to exploit the structure of the problem. In particular, we define spanning hypertrees of a hypergraph so generalizing the spanning tree of a standard graph, and show that, like in the standard min-cost flow problem, a correspondence exists between bases and spanning hypertrees. We show also that, as happens in the network simplex algorithms for the standard min-cost flow problem, most of the computations performed at each pivot operation have a direct hypergraph interpretation.},

We show several examples of social, biological, ecological and technological systems where the use of complex networks gives very limited information about the structure of the system. Consequently, we extend the concepts of subgraph centrality and clustering for complex networks represented by hypergraphs: complex hyper-networks. The first parameter characterizes the node participation in different sub-hypergraphs and the second one characterizes the transitivity in the hyper-network through the proportion of hyper-triangles to paths of length two. Another measure characterizing the formation of triples of mutually adjacent groups in the hyper-network is also introduced. All of these characteristics are studied in three different hyper-networks: a scientific collaboration hyper-network, an ecological competition hyper-network and the hyper-network formed by the American corporate elite in 1999. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Kirouac2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding the information-processing capabilities of signal transduction networks, how those networks are disrupted in disease, and rationally designing therapies to manipulate diseased states require systematic and accurate reconstruction of network topology. Data on networks central to human physiology, such as the inflammatory signalling networks analyzed here, are found in a multiplicity of on-line resources of pathway and interactome databases (Cancer CellMap, GeneGo, KEGG, NCI-Pathway Interactome Database (NCI-PID), PANTHER, Reactome, I2D, and STRING). We sought to determine whether these databases contain overlapping information and whether they can be used to construct high reliability prior knowledge networks for subsequent modeling of experimental data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We have assembled an ensemble network from multiple on-line sources representing a significant portion of all machine-readable and reconcilable human knowledge on proteins and protein interactions involved in inflammation. This ensemble network has many features expected of complex signalling networks assembled from high-throughput data: a power law distribution of both node degree and edge annotations, and topological features of a "bow tie" architecture in which diverse pathways converge on a highly conserved set of enzymatic cascades focused around PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK, JAK/STAT, NF$\kappa$B, and apoptotic signaling. Individual pathways exhibit "fuzzy" modularity that is statistically significant but still involving a majority of "cross-talk" interactions. However, we find that the most widely used pathway databases are highly inconsistent with respect to the actual constituents and interactions in this network. Using a set of growth factor signalling networks as examples (epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta, tumor necrosis factor, and wingless), we find a multiplicity of network topologies in which receptors couple to downstream components through myriad alternate paths. Many of these paths are inconsistent with well-established mechanistic features of signalling networks, such as a requirement for a transmembrane receptor in sensing extracellular ligands.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Wide inconsistencies among interaction databases, pathway annotations, and the numbers and identities of nodes associated with a given pathway pose a major challenge for deriving causal and mechanistic insight from network graphs. We speculate that these inconsistencies are at least partially attributable to cell, and context-specificity of cellular signal transduction, which is largely unaccounted for in available databases, but the absence of standardized vocabularies is an additional confounding factor. As a result of discrepant annotations, it is very difficult to identify biologically meaningful pathways from interactome networks a priori. However, by incorporating prior knowledge, it is possible to successively build out network complexity with high confidence from a simple linear signal transduction scaffold. Such reduced complexity networks appear suitable for use in mechanistic models while being richer and better justified than the simple linear pathways usually depicted in diagrams of signal transduction.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Structural analysis of cellular interaction networks contributes to a deeper understanding of network-wide interdependencies, causal relationships, and basic functional capabilities. While the structural analysis of metabolic networks is a well-established field, similar methodologies have been scarcely developed and applied to signaling and regulatory networks. RESULTS: We propose formalisms and methods, relying on adapted and partially newly introduced approaches, which facilitate a structural analysis of signaling and regulatory networks with focus on functional aspects. We use two different formalisms to represent and analyze interaction networks: interaction graphs and (logical) interaction hypergraphs. We show that, in interaction graphs, the determination of feedback cycles and of all the signaling paths between any pair of species is equivalent to the computation of elementary modes known from metabolic networks. Knowledge on the set of signaling paths and feedback loops facilitates the computation of intervention strategies and the classification of compounds into activators, inhibitors, ambivalent factors, and non-affecting factors with respect to a certain species. In some cases, qualitative effects induced by perturbations can be unambiguously predicted from the network scheme. Interaction graphs however, are not able to capture AND relationships which do frequently occur in interaction networks. The consequent logical concatenation of all the arcs pointing into a species leads to Boolean networks. For a Boolean representation of cellular interaction networks we propose a formalism based on logical (or signed) interaction hypergraphs, which facilitates in particular a logical steady state analysis (LSSA). LSSA enables studies on the logical processing of signals and the identification of optimal intervention points (targets) in cellular networks. LSSA also reveals network regions whose parametrization and initial states are crucial for the dynamic behavior. We have implemented these methods in our software tool CellNetAnalyzer (successor of FluxAnalyzer) and illustrate their applicability using a logical model of T-Cell receptor signaling providing non-intuitive results regarding feedback loops, essential elements, and (logical) signal processing upon different stimuli. CONCLUSION: The methods and formalisms we propose herein are another step towards the comprehensive functional analysis of cellular interaction networks. Their potential, shown on a realistic T-cell signaling model, makes them a promising tool.},

abstract = {This is the textbook for the course Mathematical Writing, offered to second year undergraduate students in mathematics at Queen Mary, University of London. Instructions on writing mathematics are normally given to postgraduate stu- dents, to prepare them to write research articles and a thesis. However, there are compelling reasons for providing such a training at a much earlier stage in one’s education. These include: • to raise the profile of writing in a mathematics degree —it’s a vital skill and many students are not good at it (see [9]); • to help the students consolidate, and perform a synthesis of, the material in- troduced in the first year; • to improve the students’ study skills, and help them develop a coherent ap- proach to conceptualisation; • to teach some elements of higher mathematics —logic, in particular—using language as a tool; • to give the students specific training on developing mathematical arguments and proofs; • to prepare the students for writing a final year project. Writing encourages the students to look at structural properties of the mathemat- ical objects being considered; furthermore, having to use the highly specialised language of mathematics with precision and fluency is a rigorous exercise. The stu- dents’ achievements in this area will enrich their learning experience, and provide them with a skill whose importance cannot be overestimated. The present course represents an evolution of the module Logic I: mathemati- cal writing, designed byWilfrid Hodges, who taught it at Queen Mary in 2005 and 2006. This was a course on logic, which used writing as an essential tool. The present module places greater emphasis on writing and less on logic; this new bal- ance reflects a transition from a pilot course to a mainstream one, designed for large classes. The pre-requisite for this course is knowledge of standard first-year material from Calculus, Geometry and Algebra. Writing will always be closely linked to the underlying mathematical ideas, and the development of writing techniques will proceed from the particular to the general, from the small to the large: words, sen- tences, paragraphs, to end with short documents. These may represent a proof of a theorem, a summary of a larger document, or the first stages of a presentation. We begin by listing some basic dos and don’ts of writing, in chapter 1. In ] does not appear, mathematical symbols are intended to be used freely.) In an appropriate context, having to express mathematics without symbols is a most use- ful exercise, which encourages attention to structure and economy of thought. It also brings about the discipline needed to use symbols effectively, and it’s invalu- able for learning how to communicate to an audience of non-experts. The present web-book is inspired by, and at times directly copied from,Wilfrid’s written material should contain no mathematical symbols, apart from numerals, while the integer n specifies the approximate word length of the assignment. (If [ ] and [ lecture notes (particularly chapters 9 and 10) which are available on http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/{\~{}}wilfrid/logicone/ Some material in chapter 2 was extracted from the Phrase-book, written by Peter Kropholler and me http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/{\~{}}fv/misc/phrasebook.pdf Plainly, any error contained in this document cannot be ascribed to the above sources. The timeless, concise book The elements of style, by William Strunk Jr and E. B. White [6] is an ideal complement to the present textbook. Anyone interested in chapter 2 we name the basic objects of mathematics: sets, functions, sequences, equations. All higher mathematics is based on these words. The analysis of math- ematical reasoning begins in chapter 3, where some constructs of elementary logic (predicate algebra) are developed. This material underpins a detailed study of math- ematical arguments and proofs, which is found in chapters 6–9. Some chapters are dedicated explicitly to writing. Thus chapter 1 gives basic writing tips, chapter 5 is concerned with effectiveness and clarity in writing, beginning with the rules for assigning symbols to words in a coherent manner. Chapter 10 deals with biblio- graphical references, and the last chapter contains a short introduction to mark-up languages. The symbols [ , n] appear often in exercises. They indicate that the $\epsilon$ $\epsilon$ $\epsilon$ writing should study it carefully. The book Mathematical writing, by Donald E. Knuth, Tracy L. Larrabee, and Paul M. Roberts [5] has been another source of inspiration. It’s written for postgrad- uate students and researchers, and hence is too advanced for this course. Nonethe- less, it provides useful further reading. The book A primer of mathematical writing, by Steven G. Krantz [4], is written for a similar audience. Very different in style, but equally valuable, is the classic text Writing mathematics well, by Leonard Gill- man [2]. Unfortunately, this 50-page booklet is out of print, and used copies may command high prices. I am indebted withWill Clavering,Wilfrid Hodges, and Sally Mitchell for their advice and encouragement throughout this project. The development of the first draft of this book was made possible by a grant from the Thinking Writing Sec- ondment Scheme, at Queen Mary, University of London; their support is gratefully acknowledged.},

Recent extensions of our data model accommodate the annotation of cancer and other disease processes. First, we have extended our class of protein modifications to accommodate annotation of changes in amino acid sequence and the formation of fusion proteins to describe the proteins involved in disease processes. Second, we have added a disease attribute to reaction, pathway, and physical entity classes that uses disease ontology terms. To support the graphical representation of "cancer" pathways, we have adapted our Pathway Browser to display disease variants and events in a way that allows comparison with the wild type pathway, and shows connections between perturbations in cancer and other biological pathways. The curation of pathways associated with cancer, coupled with our efforts to create other disease-specific pathways, will interoperate with our existing pathway and network analysis tools. Using the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway as an example, we show how Reactome annotates and presents the altered biological behavior of EGFR variants due to their altered kinase and ligand-binding properties, and the mode of action and specificity of anti-cancer therapeutics.},

abstract = {Embedded within large-scale protein interaction networks are signaling pathways that encode response cascades in the cell. Unfortunately, even for well-studied species like S. cerevisiae, only a fraction of all true protein interactions are known, which makes it difficult to reason about the exact flow of signals and the corresponding causal relations in the network. To help address this problem, we introduce a framework for predicting new interactions that aid connectivity between upstream proteins (sources) and downstream transcription factors (targets) of a particular pathway. Our algorithms attempt to globally minimize the distance between sources and targets by finding a small set of shortcut edges to add to the network. Unlike existing algorithms for predicting general protein interactions, by focusing on proteins involved in specific responses our approach homes-in on pathway-consistent interactions. We applied our method to extend pathways in osmotic stress response in yeast and identified several missing interactions, some of which are supported by published reports. We also performed experiments that support a novel interaction not previously reported. Our framework is general and may be applicable to edge prediction problems in other domains.},

@article{Samaga2013,
abstract = {A central goal of systems biology is the construction of predictive models of bio-molecular networks. Cellular networks of moderate size have been modeled successfully in a quantitative way based on differential equations. However, in large-scale networks, knowledge of mechanistic details and kinetic parameters is often too limited to allow for the set-up of predictive quantitative models. Here, we review methodologies for qualitative and semi-quantitative modeling of cellular signal transduction networks. In particular, we focus on three different but related formalisms facilitating modeling of signaling processes with different levels of detail: interaction graphs, logical/Boolean networks, and logic-based ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Albeit the simplest models possible, interaction graphs allow the identification of important network properties such as signaling paths, feedback loops, or global interdependencies. Logical or Boolean models can be derived from interaction graphs by constraining the logical combination of edges. Logical models can be used to study the basic input–output behavior of the system under investigation and to analyze its qualitative dynamic properties by discrete simulations. They also provide a suitable framework to identify proper intervention strategies enforcing or repressing certain behaviors. Finally, as a third formalism, Boolean networks can be transformed into logic-based ODEs enabling studies on essential quantitative and dynamic features of a signaling network, where time and states are continuous. We describe and illustrate key methods and applications of the different modeling formalisms and discuss their relationships. In particular, as one important aspect for model reuse, we will show how these three modeling approaches can be combined to a modeling pipeline (or model hierarchy) allowing one to start with the simplest representation of a signaling network (interaction graph), which can later be refined to logical and eventually to logic-based ODE models. Importantly, systems and network properties determined in the rougher representation are conserved during these transformations.},

abstract = {Hedgehog (Hh) plays crucial roles in tissue-patterning and activates signaling in Patched (Ptc)-expressing cells. Paracrine signaling requires release and transport over many cell diameters away by a process that requires interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). Here, we examine the organization of functional, fluorescently tagged variants in living cells by using optical imaging, FRET microscopy, and mutational studies guided by bioinformatics prediction. We find that cell-surface Hh forms suboptical oligomers, further concentrated in visible clusters colocalized with HSPGs. Mutation of a conserved Lys in a predicted Hh-protomer interaction interface results in an autocrine signaling-competent Hh isoform-incapable of forming dense nanoscale oligomers, interacting with HSPGs, or paracrine signaling. Thus, Hh exhibits a hierarchical organization from the nanoscale to visible clusters with distinct functions. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

To achieve this, cells often employ signaling molecules that emanate from a local source and act at a distance on target cells. The Hedgehog morphogen is an essential signaling molecule required for numerous processes during animal development. Emphasizing the importance of this molecule for both growth control and patterning, Hedgehog signaling activity is often deregulated during cancer formation and progression. The secretion and spread of Hedgehog are not passive processes, but require accessory molecules involved in Hedgehog processing, release, spread and reception. In this review, I focus on the factors that are required to control the spread and activity of Hedgehog, highlighting recent data that have shed light on these processes. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Gli zinc-finger proteins are transcription factors involved in the intracellular signal transduction controlled by the Hedgehog family of secreted molecules. They are frequently mutated in human congenital malformations, and their abnormal regulation leads to tumorigenesis. Genetic studies in several model systems indicate that their activity is tightly regulated by Hedgehog signaling through various posttranslational modifications, including phosphorylation, ubiquitin-mediated degradation, and proteolytic processing, as well as through nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. In vertebrate cells, primary cilia are required for the sensing of Hedgehog pathway activity and involved in the processing and activation of Gli proteins. Two evolutionarily conserved Hedgehog pathway components, Suppressor of fused and Kif7, are core intracellular regulators of mammalian Gli proteins. Recent studies revealed that Gli proteins are also regulated transcriptionally and posttranslationally through noncanonical mechanisms independent of Hedgehog signaling. In this review, we describe the regulation of Gli proteins during development and discuss possible mechanisms for their abnormal activation during tumorigenesis.},

abstract = {During craniofacial development, the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway is essential for mesodermal tissue patterning and differentiation. The HH family consists of three protein ligands: Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), Indian Hedgehog (IHH), and Desert Hedgehog (DHH), of which two are expressed in the craniofacial complex (IHH and SHH). Dysregulations in HH signaling are well documented to result in a wide range of craniofacial abnormalities, including holoprosencephaly (HPE), hypotelorism, and cleft lip/palate. Furthermore, mutations in HH effectors, co-receptors, and ciliary proteins result in skeletal and craniofacial deformities. Cranial suture morphogenesis is a delicate developmental process that requires control of cell commitment, proliferation and differentiation. This review focuses on both what is known and what remains unknown regarding HH signaling in cranial suture morphogenesis and intramembranous ossification. As demonstrated from murine studies, expression of both SHH and IHH is critical to the formation and fusion of the cranial sutures and calvarial ossification. SHH expression has been observed in the cranial suture mesenchyme and its precise function is not fully defined, although some postulate SHH to delay cranial suture fusion. IHH expression is mainly found on the osteogenic fronts of the calvarial bones, and functions to induce cell proliferation and differentiation. Unfortunately, neonatal lethality of IHH deficient mice precludes a detailed examination of their postnatal calvarial phenotype. In summary, a number of basic questions are yet to be answered regarding domains of expression, developmental role, and functional overlap of HH morphogens in the calvaria. Nevertheless, SHH and IHH ligands are integral to cranial suture development and regulation of calvarial ossification. When HH signaling goes awry, the resultant suite of morphologic abnormalities highlights the important roles of HH signaling in cranial development.},

@article{Chen2011,
abstract = {The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway has important functions during metazoan development. The Hh ligand is generated from a precursor by self-cleavage, which requires a free cysteine in the C-terminal part of the protein and results in the production of the cholesterol-modified ligand and a C-terminal fragment. In this paper, we demonstrate that these reactions occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The catalytic cysteine needs to form a disulfide bridge with a conserved cysteine, which is subsequently reduced by protein disulfide isomerase. Generation of the C-terminal fragment is followed by its ER-associated degradation (ERAD), providing the first example of an endogenous luminal ERAD substrate that is constitutively degraded. This process requires the ubiquitin ligase Hrd1, its partner Sel1, the cytosolic adenosine triphosphatase p97, and degradation by the proteasome. Processing-defective mutants of Hh are degraded by the same ERAD components. Thus, processing of the Hh precursor competes with its rapid degradation, explaining the impaired Hh signaling of processing-defective mutants, such as those causing human holoprosencephaly.},
