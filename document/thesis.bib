@article{Cambini1997,
abstract = {Directed hypergraphs have been introduced quite recently in connection with different application areas, such as propositional satisfiability, deductive data bases and Leontief substitution systems. In [Jeroslow, Martin, Rardin{\&}Wang, 1989], the uncapacitated min-cost flow problem on hypergraphs is considered, and its properties are studied. Here we address the capacitated case, and show how the simplex operations can be specialized in order to exploit the structure of the problem. In particular, we define spanning hypertrees of a hypergraph so generalizing the spanning tree of a standard graph, and show that, like in the standard min-cost flow problem, a correspondence exists between bases and spanning hypertrees. We show also that, as happens in the network simplex algorithms for the standard min-cost flow problem, most of the computations performed at each pivot operation have a direct hypergraph interpretation.},

@article{Conant2008,
abstract = {With a view toward studying the homotopy type of spaces of Boolean formulae, we introduce a simplicial complex, called the theta complex, associated to any hypergraph, which is the Alexander dual of the more well-known independence complex. In particular, the set of satisfiable formulae in k-conjunctive normal form with less than or equal to n variables has the homotopy type of Theta(Cube(n,n-k)), where Cube(n,n-k) is a hypergraph associated to the (n-k)-skeleton of an n-cube. We make partial progress in calculating the homotopy type of theta for these cubical hypergraphs, and we also give calculations and examples for other hypergraphs as well. Indeed studying the theta complex of hypergraphs is an interesting problem in its own right.},

@article{Samaga2013,
abstract = {A central goal of systems biology is the construction of predictive models of bio-molecular networks. Cellular networks of moderate size have been modeled successfully in a quantitative way based on differential equations. However, in large-scale networks, knowledge of mechanistic details and kinetic parameters is often too limited to allow for the set-up of predictive quantitative models.Here, we review methodologies for qualitative and semi-quantitative modeling of cellular signal transduction networks. In particular, we focus on three different but related formalisms facilitating modeling of signaling processes with different levels of detail: interaction graphs, logical/Boolean networks, and logic-based ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Albeit the simplest models possible, interaction graphs allow the identification of important network properties such as signaling paths, feedback loops, or global interdependencies. Logical or Boolean models can be derived from interaction graphs by constraining the logical combination of edges. Logical models can be used to study the basic input-output behavior of the system under investigation and to analyze its qualitative dynamic properties by discrete simulations. They also provide a suitable framework to identify proper intervention strategies enforcing or repressing certain behaviors. Finally, as a third formalism, Boolean networks can be transformed into logic-based ODEs enabling studies on essential quantitative and dynamic features of a signaling network, where time and states are continuous.We describe and illustrate key methods and applications of the different modeling formalisms and discuss their relationships. In particular, as one important aspect for model reuse, we will show how these three modeling approaches can be combined to a modeling pipeline (or model hierarchy) allowing one to start with the simplest representation of a signaling network (interaction graph), which can later be refined to logical and eventually to logic-based ODE models. Importantly, systems and network properties determined in the rougher representation are conserved during these transformations.},

abstract = {Reactome describes biological pathways as chemical reactions that closely mirror the actual physical interactions that occur in the cell. Recent extensions of our data model accommodate the annotation of cancer and other disease processes. First, we have extended our class of protein modifications to accommodate annotation of changes in amino acid sequence and the formation of fusion proteins to describe the proteins involved in disease processes. Second, we have added a disease attribute to reaction, pathway, and physical entity classes that uses disease ontology terms. To support the graphical representation of "cancer" pathways, we have adapted our Pathway Browser to display disease variants and events in a way that allows comparison with the wild type pathway, and shows connections between perturbations in cancer and other biological pathways. The curation of pathways associated with cancer, coupled with our efforts to create other disease-specific pathways, will interoperate with our existing pathway and network analysis tools. Using the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway as an example, we show how Reactome annotates and presents the altered biological behavior of EGFR variants due to their altered kinase and ligand-binding properties, and the mode of action and specificity of anti-cancer therapeutics.},
